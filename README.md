# bms-bot

G'day <br />
This is the BMS Bot <br />
It does BMS things in the MU BMS Discord <br />
<br />
A few things to note;
- A file called config.json does exist however is not accessible here as it contains the Discord bot token
- A folder containing image assets used by the bot also exists but is not accessible here as well
<br />
That aside,
The code functions in a straightforward fashion.
Node.js is used to fire up the index.js file which fetches commands and acts as the center of the bot's operations.
These commands are located in the commands folder in subfolders depending on their functions. <br />
<br />
The code requires the discord.js, r2 and node.js packages. <br />
<br />
If you would like to contribute to the bot in any way, feel free to send me a DM on Discord (@Baker#8842)
